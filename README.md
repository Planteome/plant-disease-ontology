# plant-stress-ontology
Repository for the Plant Stress Ontology



Please use the files in this repository with caution- the PSO is very much in the testing and preliminary stage right now. 

We are currently adding the diseases and pathogens sourced from the American Phytopathological Society (http://www.apsnet.org/publications/commonnames/Pages/default.aspx), primarily focusing on the rice and maize at this time.

We are not "creating a taxonomy", but we are resolving some very complex naming issues, using the APS, NCBI and the EOL. All the pathogens we are adding are referencing their taxon ids in NCBI If they have one).

Once we have a number in, we will import the taxonomy slice that we have created (see https://github.com/Planteome/planteome-ncbi-taxonomy).
